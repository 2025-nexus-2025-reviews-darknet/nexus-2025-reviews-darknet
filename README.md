# nexus 2025 reviews dark&#8239;net


If you’ve heard about Nexus and are looking for real info in 2025, you’re not alone. A lot of people are asking whether it’s still running, if it’s safe, and if vendors are actually shipping.


Here’s what I found after checking recent user reports, forum chatter, and uptime logs.


## Is Nexus still active in 2025?


Yes - but with caveats. The market has been up and down this year. Some weeks it loads fine. Other times, it’s offline for days. That’s common with smaller markets trying to stay under the radar.


Don’t expect the stability of older, bigger markets that got shut down. Nexus runs lean, and that means occasional downtime.


## What are users saying?


Most recent reviews mention fast vendor responses and decent product quality - especially for digital goods and certain chemicals. But there are complaints too.


Some buyers say their orders never arrived. Others report vendors disappearing after payment. That’s not unique to Nexus, but it’s happening more often there than on more established platforms.


## Security and scams


Nexus uses PGP and two-factor authentication, which is good. But there’s no multisig escrow. That means your money goes straight to the vendor once you confirm the order.


If the vendor ghosts you, getting your coins back is almost impossible. So stick to vendors with 100+ sales and high ratings. Even then, keep orders small at first.


## Why people still use it


It’s one of the few markets that hasn’t been exit-scammed yet in 2025. That counts for something. The interface is basic but functional. No flashy design, just listings, messages, and checkout.


And because it’s not the biggest market, it flies under law enforcement’s radar a bit longer - though that could change any week.


## Should you trust it?


Maybe. But don’t go in blind.


Check recent forum threads before logging in. See if others are reporting issues that day. Use a clean Tor setup. Never reuse passwords or wallets.


And remember: no dark&#8239;net market is 100% safe. Nexus has held up so far in 2025, but that doesn’t guarantee it’ll last the year.


If you decide to check it out, go slow. Test with a small order. Watch your back.


That’s the reality - not hype, not fear, just what’s actually happening right now.
